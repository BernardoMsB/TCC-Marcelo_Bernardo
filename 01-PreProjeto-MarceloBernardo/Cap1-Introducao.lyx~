Since its revelation in 2007, the Brazilian pre-salt has brought possibilities
 and ambitions regarding Brazil's energy autonomy.
 The economic impacts generated by this discovery were crucial to revolutionize
 not only the country's energy sector but the economy as a whole.
 With advances in research and development activities for offshore field
 exploration, a race for quick results began, justifying the abandonment
 of past guidelines, such as onshore exploration, partially replaced in
 1966 by offshore exploration

The decision to explore oil offshore made Brazil assume even greater economic
 risks than those already existing onshore.
 Factors such as wind speed, wave height, current directions, hydrostatic
 pressures, low temperatures on the seabed, and the ductile characteristics
 of carbonate rocks are some of the technical challenges faced for the feasibili
ty of exploration in the pre-salt fields

One of the main discoveries in this region was the Santos Basin, located
 in the southeast of Brazil, covering the coastlines of the states of Rio
 de Janeiro, São Paulo, Paraná, and Santa Catarina.
 Geologically, the Santos Basin is bounded to the north by the Campos Basin,
 near the Cabo Frio high, while its southern border is established near
 the Florianópolis high, in the Pelotas Basin

 discuss that most commercially used oil reserves are formed in deposits
 in reservoirs composed of sedimentary rocks, both clastic and non-clastic,
 with sandstones and limestones being the most predominant.
 However, other types of rocks can also exhibit sufficient porosity to be
 considered important reservoirs.
 In these cases, porosity may result from interstitial spaces, although
 it is often attributed to the existence of fractures.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For oil to be stored in the reservoir rock, it is essential that the rock
 has porosity, allowing it to retain the fluid, as well as permeability,
 a fundamental characteristic.
 Permeability determines the capacity of the porous medium to allow fluid
 passage, acting as a measure of fluid conductivity in a material.
 The evaluation of porosity and permeability plays a crucial role in describing
 a reservoir and defining flow patterns, aiming to improve oil production
 efficiency

Carbonate rocks have characteristics that give them high complexity.
 In addition to difficulties in evaluating rock properties, many carbonates
 exhibit lateral structural heterogeneities, admitting, therefore, high

The Barra Velha Formation is composed of carbonate rock deposits found in
 the area of the petroleum play known as the 'Pre-salt.' The Santos Basin,
 in turn, can be classified as a passive continental margin basin and undergoes
 three distinct tectonostratigraphic evolutionary phases: the rift phase,
 followed by the post-rift phase, and finally, the drift phase.

 into two depositional sequences, the lower and upper, separated by a regionally
 significant unconformity at the basin scale.
 As highlighted by these authors, this formation, of Eoaptian age, is characteri
zed by limestone/laminite of microbial origin, stromatolites, and microbialites
 that are either partially or entirely dolomitized.
 It is also rich in talc and magnesian clays in the proximal portions and
 carbonate shales in the distal portions, deposited over the Pré-Alagoas
 unconformity.
 On the other hand, the upper Barra Velha Formation, of Neoaptian age, consists
 of conglomeratic-arenitic alluvial fans in the proximal portions and stromatoli
tic limestones and microbial laminite, locally dolomitized, in the distal
 portions of the basin

Therefore, precise analysis of pore size distribution is crucial to understandin

 In this work, a study will be developed to analyze the pore size distribution

 pressure applied to the sample, meaning larger pore throat diameters are
 identified at low pressures, and vice versa.
 Additionally, he found that the smallest pore size identified in this analysis
 is 3.5 nm in diameter, at a maximum pressure of 60,000 psi.

\begin_layout Standard
In light of the significant discovery of the pre-salt in the Santos Basin,
 specifically in the Barra Velha Formation, it becomes imperative to conduct
 a detailed analysis of the pore size distribution in this formation.
 The use of Mercury Intrusion Porosimetry (MIP) emerges as the primary approach
 to achieve this objective.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The scope of this work focuses on the application of MIP as a fundamental
 tool to assess the porosity of the Barra Velha Formation.
 The main emphasis lies in the analysis of pore size distribution, a crucial
 step in understanding the viability and potential use of these materials.
 The classification of pores into micropores, mesopores, and macropores
 will be an integral part of the analysis process, with the intention of
 categorizing and comprehending the porous structure at different scales.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To achieve such classification, various models will be employed, with the
 Washburn Model standing out as a specific tool to describe the dynamics
 of mercury intrusion into fine pores.
 Understanding these intrusion patterns will not only provide valuable insights
 into pore distribution but also enable a more precise characterization
 of the porosity of the Barra Velha Formation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the end of this study, the expectation is to not only provide a comprehensive
 analysis of pore size distribution but also contribute to a broader understandi
ng of the porous properties of this specific geological formation.
 This contribution has the potential to directly influence future strategies
 for exploration and oil production in this strategic region of the Santos
 Basin.
